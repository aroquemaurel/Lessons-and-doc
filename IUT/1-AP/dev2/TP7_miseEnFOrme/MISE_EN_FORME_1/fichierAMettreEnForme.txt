#C8000 Abstract #J8005
We present a design, including its movitation, for introducing concurrency into C++.
The design work is based on a set of requirements and elementary execution properties that generate a corresponding
set of programming language constructs needed to express concurrency. #G6002 The new constructs continue to
support
object-oriented
facilities such as inheritance and code reuse. Features that allow flexibility in accepting and subsequently
postponing
servicing of
requests are provided. #D4000 Currently, a major portion of the design is implemented, supporting concurrent programs on
shared-memory
uniprocessor and multiprocessor computers.
